[Characters]
 ;How to add characters
 ;---------------------
 ;Use the format:
 ;    charname, stagefilename
 ;
 ;eg. For a player with filename "kfm",
 ;    and stage filename "stages/mybg.def"
 ;type (without the semicolon):
 ;    kfm, stages/mybg.def
 ;
 ;If you want to load a different def file, you can enter it
 ;as a directory plus the def file. This example loads up
 ;chars/kfm/alt-kfm.def:
 ;    kfm/alt-kfm.def, stages/mybg.def
 ;
 ;If you put "random" as the stagefilename, then a random stage will
 ;be selected for that player. eg.
 ;    kfm, random
 ;
 ;Zipped characters are also supported.
 ;Place the ZIP file in the chars/ directory. The syntax is as
 ;follows:
 ;    zipname.zip:defname.def, stages/mybg.def
 ;For example, if you have newsuave.def in suave.zip, the syntax is:
 ;    suave.zip:newsuave.def, stages/mybg.def
 ;If your def file has the same name as the zip file (eg. suave.def
 ;in suave.zip), you can just put the name of the zip file alone:
 ;    suave.zip, stages/mybg.def
 ;
 ;Optional parameters may follow on the same line, separated
 ;by commas. Each parameter has the form:
 ;    paramname = paramvalue
 ;where paramname is the name of the parameter type, and
 ;paramvalue is the value to assign that parameter.
 ;The optional parameters are:
 ;
 ; - music
 ;   Set the paramvalue to the name of the music file to use
 ;   as the BGM for that character. This overrides the bgmusic
 ;   parameter in the stage's .def file, so you can re-use the
 ;   same stage for multiple characters, but have a different
 ;   BGM playing for each person.
 ;
 ; - includestage
 ;   Set the paramvalue to 0 to avoid including this stage
 ;   in the stage select list (in VS, training modes, etc)
 ;
 ; - order
 ;   Set the paramvalue to the ordering priority to give the
 ;   character. Valid values are from 1 to 10. A smaller value
 ;   means you will fight the character sooner. You will never
 ;   fight an order 2 character before an order 1 character,
 ;   and never an order 3 character before an order 2 one.
 ;   For example, you might want to set your boss character
 ;   to have order=3. The default order value is 1 if you omit
 ;   this param. See *.maxmatches under [Options] for how to
 ;   limit the number of matches per order priority.
 ;
 ;   Some examples:
 ;        kfm, stages/mybg.def, includestage=0
 ;        kfm, stages/mybg.def, music=sound/song.mp3
 ;        kfm, stages/mybg.def, music=sound/song.mp3, includestage=0
 ;        kfm, stages/mybg.def, order=3
 ;
 ;You can also add a randomize icon to the select screen. To do
 ;this, put the word "randomselect" on a line of its own, with no
 ;extra parameters.
 ;
 ;Insert your characters below.

[Options]
 ;Here you set the maximum number of matches to fight before game ends in arcade
 ;mode. The first number is the number of matches against characters with
 ;order=1, followed by order=2 and order=3 respectively. For example, for 4,3,1
 ;you will fight up to 4 randomly-picked characters who have order=1, followed
 ;by 3 with order=2 and 1 with order=3.
 ;IKEMEN feature: Max 30 orders mugen limitation is lifted.
 ;IKEMEN feature: Characters can use individual maxmatches settings (see
 ;'maxmatches' parameter in [Characters] section)

 ;Maximum number of matches to fight before game ends in Arcade single mode.
arcade.maxmatches = 2,2,2,2,3,3,2,2,0,0

 ;Like arcade.maxmatches, but applies to Arcade team modes (sans 'Ratio').
team.maxmatches = 2,2,2,2,3,3,2,2,0,0

 ;Maximum number of matches to fight before game ends in Time Attack mode.
timeattack.maxmatches = 2,2,2,2,3,3,2,2,0,0

 ;IKEMEN feature: Similar to arcade.maxmatches, but applies to Survival mode.
 ;Use -1 value to choose which order number should have unlimited matches.
 ;By omitting -1 survival mode will end after particular amount of matches set
 ;below (in such case you can actually "complete" the mode).
survival.maxmatches = -1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,0

 ;IKEMEN feature: A 'Ratio' mode allows each team to select up to 3 characters
 ;and distribute 4 "ratio levels" amongst them, affecting their life and damage
 ;(ratio 2 is the default to which other ratios are compared, percentages are
 ;adjustable in options screen).
 ;Arcade ratio matches use 'ratiomatches' configuration instead of 'maxmatches'
 ;settings. Each entry here, separated by commas, represents a single match and
 ;consists of 2 assignments, separated by colon. Assignment on the left side of
 ;colon refers to the number of characters you will face in this match (valid
 ;numbers from 1 to 3, or a random selection range, consisting of one number,
 ;followed by a dash and another number). Assignment written after colon refers
 ;to character's order param, that can be used to limit which characters should
 ;be randomly chosen for this match. For example 2-3:4 entry means a match
 ;against team of 2 or 3 characters, chosen from characters with order=4.
arcade.ratiomatches = 1-3:1, 3:1, 2:1, 2:1, 1:2, 3:1, 1-2:3,1-2:4,1:5,1-3:5,2:6,1-3:7,1:8

 ;AI ramping
 ;IKEMEN feature: AI ramping settings has been moved here from mugen.cfg
 ;You can view AI ramping output for all battles from the last chosen mode via
 ;debug/t_aiRamp.txt (useful reference also for vanilla mugen).

 ;Arcade / Time Attack single mode AI ramping
 ;For both parameters below, the first number corresponds to the number of
 ;matches won, and the second number to the AI difficulty offset. The actual
 ;difficulty is the sum of the AI difficulty level (set in the options menu) and
 ;the value of the offset at a particular match.
 ;  AIramp.start = start_match, start_diff
 ;  AIramp.end   = end_match, end_diff
 ;The difficulty offset function is a constant value of start_diff from the
 ;first match until start_match matches have been won. From then the offset
 ;value increases linearly from start_diff to end_diff. After end_diff matches
 ;have been won, the offset value is end_diff.
 ;  e_d            /----------
 ;               /
 ;  s_d _______/
 ;     ^      ^     ^        ^
 ;   1st_m   s_m   e_m     last_m
 ;For example, if you have:
 ;  AIramp.start = 2,0
 ;  AIramp.end   = 4,2
 ;For 6 matches at level 4, the difficulty will be (by match):
 ;  4,4,4,5,6,6

;arcade.AIramp.start = 2, 0
;arcade.AIramp.end   = 4, 2

 ;Arcade / Time Attack team modes AI ramping (sans 'Ratio')
 ;For 4 matches at level 4 and default values, the difficulty will be:
 ;  4,4,5,6

team.AIramp.start = 1, 0
team.AIramp.end   = 3, 2

 ;Arcade / Time Attack 'Ratio' mode AI ramping
 ;For 4 matches at level 4 and default values, the difficulty will be:
 ;  4,4,5,6

ratio.AIramp.start = 1, 0
ratio.AIramp.end   = 3, 2

 ;Survival Mode AI ramping
 ;For 16 matches at level 4 and default values, the difficulty will be:
 ;  1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8

;survival.AIramp.start = 0, -3
;survival.AIramp.end   = 16, 4
