	[WHAT THE HELL IS THIS STUFF?]

	This is a spark set (fightfx) for the MUGEN fighting engine. But you probably already know it
	if you got it, buh.
	


	[NOTES]
	
	-Particle Illusion rocks, these sparks suck. Now, can you see a connection between the two?
	-This sparkset makes KFM look cool.
	


	[INSTALLATION]

	Just unzip this file into the data\ folder of your MUGEN folder, and choose to overwrite if you're
	asked to and want to remove your old spark set



	[NOTICE]
	
	I don't really take credit for this sparkset since Particle Illusion made most of the work for me.
	You can host host it, put it into your screenpack, take them apart and use them on your character, 
	I don't  really care: just credit me and link back to my site, and make sure you tell me so I can
	check.

	[THANK YOU LIST]
	Wondertouch for Particle Illusion.
	Mattasaur for the blood sparks, although he's not around anymore.
