<#f0f000>Information :</>

Stiyl is a setup/setplay based character with an install.

His main resource are <#ff0000>cards</>,
which he has <#ff0000>200</> at roundstart.
He gains <#ff0000>100-cards</> after each round.
You can go as high as <#ff0000>999-cards</>.
All his specials, supers and hypers require
<#ff0000>cards</> to perform or activate them.
So to be viable with Stiyl is to keep track of <#ff0000>cards</>,
and have enough <#ff0000>cards</> all the time.

He also has an install available to him by sacrificing
a set number of <#ff0000>cards</> to get stronger for a long period
of time.

When he uses the install to go all out,
he uses his magic name of <#ff0000>Fortis931</>


<#f0f000>Install :</>

_`<#ff0000>Heat Mode :</> This is a comeback mechanic that
needs to be grinded before unleashing it.
You activate it as soon as you have at least
<#ff0000>931-cards</> available.
You consume <#ff0000>30-cards</>/sec during it.

Here are the effects of the install :
_`It makes your attack increase twofold after consuming
<#ff0000>333-cards</>.
_`It also decreases your defence twofold after consuming
<#ff0000>333-cards</>.
_`Your charge up animation changes and deals damage.
_`During <#ff0000>Heat Mode</>, all the specials requiring <#ff0000>cards</>
now don't require any.


<#f0f000>XYZs :</>

Only this much ?						^S
(comes in tandem with his ^Y ability)

Run										_F_F
Back Hop								_B_B
Back Dash								_B_B (air)

Card charge								^LP / ^X
(As its name implies you get to charge your cards.
The rate of which you charge <#ff0000>cards</> is <#ff0000>60-cards</>/sec.)
<#00ff00>Lvl-1.5</>
Instant Card Charge						^LP_+^HK / ^X_+^C
(Gives <#ff0000>200-cards</> instantly)
Grab Explosion							_F^LP or _B^LP / _F^X or _B^X

Back Charge								_B_B^LP / _B_B^X (air OK)
(During a Back Hop, you can press ^LP / ^X

Heat Mode								_D_D^LP / _D_D^X
(You can activate it by either using the normal motion
or by pressing ^LK_+^MK / ^A_+^B when hit by the
opponent.)

<#ff0000>20-cards</>
Mirage									^MP / ^Y
<#00ff00>Lvl-0.5</>
_!Mirage Counter						^MP / ^Y (hold)
(if Mirage is hit and Stiyl isn't hit)

<#ffff00>About Mirage :</>
It will create a mirage that does the same animation
as the taunt. During that time Stiyl will be able
to move around while being invisible.
He'll return to be visible by either the mirage finishing
or by attacking during the mirage.

If the mirage is hit, then it will disappear... like a mirage.

To know if it's a mirage or a taunt, the general rule
of thumb is the following :
_`The taunt is more likely to say "Only this much ?"
"Kono tedo kai ?"
_`The mirage is more likely to say "Good Grief"
"Yare yare"

Also if you are both on the ground and holding
down ^MP / ^Y and have enough meter,
it will make Stiyl go behind the opponent and
immobilise them if it connects
while consuming meter.

(During a Back Hop, you can press ^MP / ^Y
as many times as possible to set down trap cards)

The more the cards you have and
the more the levels you have
the more damaging the attack.
However to get to the higher levels you need
to hold down the button more.

The visual cue is the Fire turning bluer.
However that doesn't necessarily mean that
you will get a higher level super.

You have to keep track of how many cards
and levels you have.

Here are the 3 levels of power :

_`<#ff0000>120-cards</> _+ <#00ff00>Lvl-2</> _+ holding ^HK / ^C half-way
