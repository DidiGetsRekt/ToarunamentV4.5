Will meter : 3 lvls of will
the higher the lvl of will at disposal the stronger the move (which will now be addressed as W1, W2, W3)
every time a move utilising this meter is performed, the will meter will decrease between 1 and 0.5.
this is depending on the difference of health between you and the opponent
(if you have the same health it'll cost 0.75, if the opponent has a health lead on you it'll go closer to 1, closer to 0.5 for vice versa, half of a health bar difference or higher will be point where it'll get to either 1 or 0.5 depending on the situation)
you can increase your will by attacking the opponent, your will gets decreased the more damage the opponent inflicts you

5x -> Will needle : restores 1 W in exchange of some minor damage
22x -> EX Will needle : restores max W in exchange of some minor damage and 1 bar of meter which will be referred from now on as lvl-1)


236 series gun and sword

step 1 : conjuring gun
step 2 : loading the gun
step 3 : shooting the gun (this step can be canceled into other specials)

a -> bullets (used for damage)
W1 : 1 bullet
W2 : 5 bullets
W3 : 10 bullets

b -> sword (used to overwhelm/camp the opponent)
W1 -> 1 sword launch
W2 -> 1 sword launch that comes back around after it goes out of the screen
W3 -> 5 swords that also come back
you can also hold up to send the sword diagonally up

lvl-1
c -> gun and swords
W1 -> 1 bullet and 1 sword
W2 -> the 10 bullets into the sword
W3 -> the sword into the 10 swords

214 series miscellanous types

a -> almost instant but short range
W1 -> electric field
W2 -> car that drops directly on top of the opponent
W3 -> guillotines that drop on all of the screen

b -> takes a while to perform but the range is long and the damage bigger
W1 -> big electric field
W2 -> road roller that drops directly on top of the opponent
W3 -> guillotines that drop on all of the screen (now this is more used as a setup instead)

lvl-1
c -> random bullshit go !
W1 -> super electric field
W2 -> ship container
W3 -> unlimited guillotines (not unlimited but it'll prolly do 3 volleys or smth)

22 series "command" types

a -> changes aureolus in some way
W1 -> Let me get to you... : tp's to the opponent after his incantation is fully done (while walking)
W2 -> Let me get to you ! : tp's to the opponent midway through
W3 -> You won't touch me... : incatation to be able to stop 1 attack (it coats aureolus with a sort of "armour" and if he gets hit once, he'll get away, be invincible, whatever to escape that move)

b -> changes the opponent
W1 -> Drop down... : drops the opponent down after incatation is performed (when in range of the command ?)
W2 -> Drop down ! : drops the opponent down midway through
W3 -> Choke... : chokes the opponent and puts him in a stun state after incatation

lvl-1
c -> varies
W1 -> You won't touch me ! : instant version of you don't touch me
W2 -> Choke ! : instant version of choke
W3 -> Fly to the sky and get torn to shreds !

health over 25%
lvl-5
W3
41236c
Die !

Installs :

lvl-2
Alchemical Imitation
5z -> copy that lags behind and copies your every move for 5 seconds

lvl-4
Perfect Will
22z -> for 5 seconds you have unlimited will and you can spam your 236 series without going through the steps


About alchemical imitation :
Since it's aureolus dummy, I need to replace the 236 series and 214 series in the shadows so that he'd replicate what he does in OT2

Ideas :

214
One knife throw, if it connects -> stuns opponent and makes them "bleed" gold
knife barrage (10 one second) -> used for flurry and stacking damage
pool of gold (entire screen low ?) -> if hit by a 236 -> would produce a spalsh and pour molten rain that would chip
golden barrier (circular around dummy) ?

236
overhead arrow ?
low arrow ?
