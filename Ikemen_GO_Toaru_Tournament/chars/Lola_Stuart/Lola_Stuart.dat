<#00ffff>Local Weapon : "St. George's Sanctuary"</>
_F_D_DF^HP / _F_D_DF^Z
(Index Beam)
Index charges for a long time to unleash
a very annoying beam.
She is vulnerable all throughout the move.
In order for this move to be effective you'll need to
take care of the adversary while she is charging.
Once she charged it and unleashed it,
it's the perfect moment to charge power
and unleash any Supers/Hypers available.

It can also be extended by mainting ^HP / ^Z to get to :
<#00ff00>Lvl-2</>
<#ff0000>Stage 2 : Eli Eli Lama Sabachtani</>
("My God, my God, why have you forsaken me ?"
Matthew 27:45-46)
The blue beam gets an additional red beam on top
signaling the second stage of it.
It is unblockable because it is the reward after
waiting for so long.

However do note that for this Local weapon to work
in general, you need to be at the right place
at the right time
