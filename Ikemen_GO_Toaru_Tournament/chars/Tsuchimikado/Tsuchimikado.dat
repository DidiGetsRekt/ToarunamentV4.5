<#f0f000>Information :</>

Tsuchimikado is a setup/shoto character
with multiple installs at his disposal.

In his gameplan, he has to keep track of
multiple elements :
_`<#0000ff>Magic</> <#ff0000>Recoil</>
_`<#00ff77>Origamis</>
_`<#00ffff>Auto Rebirth</>

When he enters one of the installs at his disposal
to go all out,
he uses his magic name of <#00bb00>Fallere825</>

<#ff00ff>About</> <#0000ff>Magic</> <#ff0000>Recoil</> <#ff00ff>:</>
Tsuchimikado is an esper-magician hybrid, so when 
he uses <#0000ff>Magic</>, he loses HP.
It also fills up the <#0000ff>Magic</> <#ff0000>Recoil</> meter, if it reaches 
the max, he loses HP and also is stunned for a bit.
The more <#0000ff>Magic</> used in a combo, the faster the 
<#0000ff>Magic</> <#ff0000>Recoil</> meter will fill up.

All <#0000ff>Magic</> moves have this effect.

<#00ff77>About Origamis :</>
Tsuchimikado has 4 origamis at his disposal :
<#000000>_`Genbu (Black, Water)</> 
<#ffffff>_`Byakko (White, Metal)</>
<#ff0000>_`Suzaku (Red, Fire)</>
<#0000ff>_`Seiryu (Blue, Wood)</>

With them he can enhance 4 of his moves in his toolkit.
Upon activating the enhancement of the moves in question,
they'll consume the respective origami.

He can also consume all of them for entering in 2 of
his 3 installs which will be later explained upon.

<#00ffff>About Auto Rebirth :</>
Tsuchimikado's esper ability is Auto Rebirth
and is split into 2 passive mechanics :
_`When he loses HP because of magic, it will slowly
heal back to where it was before.
The healing is stopped whenever Tsuchimikado is
hit, or fills the <#0000ff>Magic</> <#ff0000>Recoil</> bar.
_`All the time, he heals exponentially faster
the lower the health he has.
If he has full health, he is healing slower over time.
The closer his health is to 0, the faster it heals.
There is a slight buff if he enters one of the installs
he has available


<#f0f000>Installs :</>

<#ffffff>_`Custom Combo :</> Install where you can combo
anything into anything.
You lose the install if you get hit while in it.
You lose the install automatically after a certain time.

<#0077ff>_`Heat Mode :</> Install which enables you to use
unlimited supers during a certain time
and also unlock the nerfed version of the hyper.
You lose the install automatically after a certain time.
You also lose the install automatically
after unleashing the hyper.

<#00ffff>_`Super Heat Mode :</> Install which enables you to
unlock the true version of the hyper.
You lose the install automatically if the conditions
of entering it are no longer met.

<#f0f000>Additional Information about Installs :</>

During any install, Tsuchimikado will regenerate his health
faster as part of his second <#00ffff>Auto Rebirth</> mechanic.
For <#ffffff>Custom Combo</> and <#0077ff>Heat Mode</> it'll be 1 notch faster.
For <#00ffff>Super Heat Mode</> it'll be 2 notches faster.
The maximum of faster notches is 2.

You can stack 2 installs of different type together.
So you can't have <#0077ff>Heat Mode</> while in <#00ffff>Super Heat Mode</>
and vice versa.

While entering into another install, you refill the bar of
the previous install if it had one.

About the Feint Series :
This kind of series of movements and attacks can be
thought of like the mechanic Thor has in which he has
moves available only when he is running.
Here, the same principle applies but only from feints.
Where Dodge Feint is a sort of spot dodge and Ducking is a
forward dodge.
Both of them don't have invincibility.
You can cancel Dodge Feint into Ducking but not vice versa.
You can cancel into ^K / ^A, ^B or ^C or actual dodges
