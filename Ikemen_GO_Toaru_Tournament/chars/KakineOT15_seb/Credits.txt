Credits to Thermidor for creating the OG Kakine Teitoku, 
DidiGetsRekt (that's me!) for adding voices and editing the code

Credits to Melty Blood and its creators for providing a base to our sprites,
Toaru Majutsu no Index since that's what Kakine is from,
Toaru IF (the gacha game) for some voicelines,
tabibito's Gilgamesh character for the ice sprites,
otika's Accelerator for the dust sprites


This Kakine Teitoku has some different moves from the original, so don't hesitate to read the movelist (you can even access it ingame in IKEMEN GO)
