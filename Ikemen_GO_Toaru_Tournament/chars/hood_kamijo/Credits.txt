Credits to Otika for creating the OG Kamijou Touma, 
Gloves of Doom for respriting him into NT Touma,
Ebora for making the fisheggs hyper,
DidiGetsRekt (that's me!) for coding all the additional moves,
Seb368 for making most of the movelist

Credits to Melty Blood and its creators for providing a base to our sprites,
Toaru Majutsu no Index since that's what Touma is from,
Toaru IF (the gacha game) for some voicelines


This Kamijou Touma has some different moves from the original, so don't hesitate to read the movelist (you can even access it ingame in IKEMEN GO)

If his interactions with other Toarus don't work, it's because you have to add his name into the other characters' files
